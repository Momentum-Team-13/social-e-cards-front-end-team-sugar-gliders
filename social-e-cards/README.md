# Hello and Welcome

The concept of our project is to create a social media platform where users are able to connect via the creation of greeting cards. Copious amount of planning took place to piece together the functional components of our React Application. We decided to model the one way relationship of a popular social media platform called Twitter. On Twitter if I follow you, you donâ€™t have to follow me. Twitter is also structured with small cards that are short, sweet, and to the point. Our aim was to structure our site to model the similar interactivity of Twitter and attempt to create a positive environment where users are free to express their creativity with each new card that is made.

## Features

The concept of creating a social media application that connects users with the creation of greeting cards was a very interesting and challenging concept to piece together. Once it came together, it produced more than favorable results. Our application consists of:

-Creating a Greeting Card with the following customization options: -
Background color -
Card Outer Message -
Card Inner Message -
Image of your choosing
-Following a User
-A Following page that displays Cards created by your followed users
-A Home page that allows you to see a list of cards created by all users

## Getting Started

We have provided an application that is fairly easy to navigate. If you want to fully partake in our greeting card experience, please adhere to these steps and gain access to our newest social media platform:

-Create a User.
-Login to Create and See the Greeting Cards!
-Each button in the navigation bar will prompt you to a new screen.
-The Create Card button will allow you to create your own personalized greeting card.
-The Profile Button will allow you to see a list of all cards you created-with options to edit and delete.
-The Following Button will allow you to see a list of the users you follow along with the greeting cards they created.
-The Home Button will allow you to see a list of all of the cards that have been created by all users.
-The Log Out Button will log you out of our amazing application.

If you wish to have our application running locally please use the commands (npm install & npm start) in the terminal. We have worked very hard to provide you with a great user experience. So feel free to create some cards and connect with some great people along the way.
